# Design Patterns

Source-neutral advisor, Markdown reference catalog, MCP tooling, and dynamic workbench for software design patterns.

This plugin works across Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build, and Kimi Code. Claude
Code loads `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, Codex loads
`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, Grok Build loads `.grok-plugin/plugin.json`, and
Kimi Code loads `kimi.plugin.json`.

## MCP server

Register the `design-patterns` stdio MCP server. Claude reads `.mcp.json`,
Codex reads `.codex-mcp.json`, and the Grok/Kimi manifests reference
`.portable-mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "design-patterns": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "<plugin>/design-patterns/bin/patterns-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
