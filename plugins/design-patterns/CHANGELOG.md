# Changelog

## [0.9.3] — 2026-08-25

### Changed

- Restored the standalone repository as the release authority for the complete
  pattern-memory, hook, validation, evaluation, and documentation surface.
- Added deterministic Claude, Codex, Grok Build, and Kimi Code provider
  manifests under one `@bytedesk/design-patterns@0.9.3` release contract.
- Kept the internal Claude plugin and marketplace entries versionless so their
  installed version follows the immutable marketplace source revision.
- Vendored the Apache-2.0 license and NOTICE into the self-contained plugin
  tree and removed machine-specific documentation links.

All notable changes to the `design-patterns` plugin are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this plugin adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.2] — 2026-06-25

### Added

- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (Codex marketplace manifest, mirrors the Claude manifest plus an `interface` block) and `AGENTS.md` so the plugin loads under Codex and grok-cli in addition to Claude Code, plus `.codex-mcp.json` for the MCP server.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- PostToolUse hook matcher and recorder now recognize the `search_replace` tool name (in addition to `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit`). This is the tool used by Grok Code / the bytedesk-terminal agent and by `search_replace` edits in this environment. Ensures that code changes performed by the assistant are recorded as edit breadcrumbs to the project's pattern memory journal (`.claude/plugins/design-patterns/journal.jsonl` via `record_edit`). Updated `hooks/hooks.json` and `hooks/record_edit.py`. Tracked alongside OAuth intercept work in the terminal.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-14

Minor release: cross-session **pattern memory**. The plugin used to be entirely
stateless — every call reloaded the catalog and returned JSON, ADRs were printed
but never saved, scans were ephemeral. It now remembers what it found,
recommended, decided, and what refactors were applied, and reads that memory
back so its answers build on prior work instead of repeating it. Tracked as the
BDM-52 epic.

### Added

- **`lib/pattern_memory.py` (BDM-54):** the persistence + recall layer — an
  append-only JSONL journal at `<project-root>/.claude/plugins/design-patterns/`
  (with a per-user global fallback when the working directory is not a project
  repo). Writers (`record_scan` / `record_recommendation` / `record_decision` /
  `record_decision_status` / `record_applied` / `record_edit`) never raise;
  readers fold the journal into current decisions, a scan diff, an
  applied-pattern index, and a one-stop recall summary.
- **`patterns_record` + `patterns_recall` MCP tools (BDM-55):** record durable
  outcomes (applied refactors, ADR status changes) and recall what the project
  already knows. Dispatched dynamically — no `handle_request` change.
- **`/patterns-history` slash command (BDM-57):** the user-facing recall
  surface, backed by `patterns_recall`; registered in `SLASH_COMMAND_HELP`.
- **`patterns memory` CLI subcommands (BDM-56):** `where` / `recall` / `record`
  / `render` on `bin/patterns`, respecting the existing `--json` convention.
- **PostToolUse capture hook (BDM-56):** `hooks/hooks.json` +
  `hooks/event-emitter.sh` + `hooks/record_edit.py` drop a coarse "edit"
  breadcrumb into the journal on `Edit` / `Write` / `MultiEdit`. Never blocks a
  tool call.
- **Markdown ADR + index renderers (BDM-58):** every recorded decision or
  applied refactor regenerates `decisions/NNNN-slug.md` and `index.md` from the
  journal — deterministic, so a re-render is a git no-op.
- **`docs/adr/0001-pattern-memory.md`:** the design record for this feature.
- **`tests/test_pattern_memory.py`, `tests/test_mcp_memory.py`,
  `tests/smoke-memory.sh`:** unit, MCP-dispatch, and CLI/stdio coverage for the
  memory layer.

### Changed

- **Memory-aware skills (BDM-57):** all six skills now consult
  `patterns memory recall` before advising; `pattern-application` records the
  applied refactor afterward, `architecture-decision` records ADR status
  transitions, `architecture-issue-scan` leads with the scan `memoryDiff`.
- **Auto-capture in the existing surfaces (BDM-55 / BDM-57):** `patterns_scan`
  and CLI `scan` attach a `memoryDiff` (new / resolved smells vs the last scan of
  that path) and record the scan; `patterns_adr` and CLI `adr` record the ADR
  and surface its `adrNumber`; `patterns_recommend` surfaces `priorDecisions`
  plus a `memoryHint` when the project already has decisions for a related
  force.
- **`tests/test_catalog.py`:** isolates pattern-memory side effects to a
  throwaway dir so regression runs never touch the real journal.

### Build

- Version bumped `0.8.6` → `0.9.0` across `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
  `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `lib/pattern_mcp_server.py` (`SERVER_INFO`), and
  `lib/workbench_views.py`; the marketplace manifest's `design-patterns` entry
  and top-level version move in lockstep.

## [0.8.6] — 2026-05-14

Baseline: the plugin as onboarded into `bytedesk-marketplace` (BDM-53) from
`ByteDeskAI/design-pattern-references` — prior history lives in that repository.
At this version the plugin is entirely stateless: a source-neutral Markdown
catalog (120+ patterns plus playbooks, recipes, smells, frameworks, languages,
scorecards, snippets, taxonomy), an MCP server, 10 slash commands, 6 skills, the
`pattern-architect` agent, and a dynamic Python-backed workbench.
