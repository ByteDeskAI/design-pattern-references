tradeoffs:
  - Adds explicit structure and vocabulary for the force.

  - Pattern name becomes more important than the problem force.
  - Ownership and lifecycle rules remain implicit.
  - The implementation hides simpler language or framework idioms.
testingFocus:
  - Behavior parity at the public boundary.
  - Variant or flow-specific edge cases.
  - Regression checks for the force the pattern addresses.

  - Decision points that affect runtime behavior.

# State

## Intent
Change an object's behavior when its internal state changes by delegating to state-specific behavior.

## When To Use
- Large conditionals switch behavior by lifecycle state.
- State transitions have rules and side effects worth isolating.
- The set of states is explicit and central to the model.

## Avoid When
- A simple enum and switch is clearer.
- Transitions are not well-defined.
- State classes duplicate most behavior.

## Language Notes

### csharp
Use state objects for complex lifecycles; enums and pattern matching may be enough.

### java
Sealed types can model closed state sets cleanly.

### typescript
Discriminated unions and state machines are often better than class states.

### python
Use explicit transition tables or small state classes.

### go
State functions or small interfaces can avoid ceremony.

### rust
Enums and typestate patterns are powerful options.

### cpp
Use variants or polymorphic states depending on runtime extension needs.

## Forces
- Keep the variation point explicit without spreading conditionals or construction knowledge through callers.
- Preserve domain names and dependency direction while making behavior easier to test in isolation.
- Balance indirection against the simplicity of language-native functions, modules, records, or interfaces.

## Tradeoffs
- Improves local change isolation, but can add indirection that obscures straightforward code.
- Creates better test seams when behavior truly varies, but can fragment logic when the variation is small.
- Works best when the abstraction is named after the domain role rather than the pattern label.

## Failure Modes
- Introducing the pattern before the variation point is stable enough to justify a boundary.
- Leaking host object state into collaborators until the design becomes harder to reason about.
- Naming production types after generic pattern roles instead of domain concepts.

## Testing
- Test through the behavior boundary that callers actually use.
- Add focused tests for each variant, construction path, or collaboration rule introduced by the pattern.
- Preserve behavior with parity tests before deleting old branches or constructors.

## Observability
- For runtime-selected variants, log the selected domain strategy, factory path, state, or collaborator role at debug or trace level.
- Avoid noisy pattern-level logs; surface only decisions that help diagnose production behavior.
- Add metrics only when the pattern changes runtime routing, cost, latency, or failure behavior.

## Implementation Notes
- Introduce State at the smallest boundary where variation, construction, or collaboration changes independently.
- Prefer idiomatic language features before adding class-heavy structure.
- Keep public behavior stable first, then simplify old conditionals or construction paths once tests prove parity.
