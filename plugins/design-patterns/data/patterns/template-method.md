# Template Method

## Intent
Define an algorithm skeleton while letting subclasses or hooks customize selected steps.

## When To Use
- Several operations share a fixed sequence with variable steps.
- A framework controls the lifecycle and exposes hook points.
- Invariant ordering must be protected.

## Avoid When
- Inheritance is only being used for configuration.
- Hooks multiply until the algorithm is hard to follow.
- Composition with Strategy would make variation clearer.

## Language Notes

### csharp
Use abstract base classes sparingly; protected virtual hooks can become brittle.

### java
Common in frameworks; prefer final template methods for invariant order.

### typescript
Prefer composition or callbacks unless class inheritance is already idiomatic.

### python
Base classes with overridable hooks work but functions can be simpler.

### go
Use functions and interfaces; inheritance-style templates do not map directly.

### rust
Traits with default methods can express template behavior.

### cpp
Non-virtual interface style can protect algorithm order.

## Forces
- Keep the variation point explicit without spreading conditionals or construction knowledge through callers.
- Preserve domain names and dependency direction while making behavior easier to test in isolation.
- Balance indirection against the simplicity of language-native functions, modules, records, or interfaces.

## Tradeoffs
- Improves local change isolation, but can add indirection that obscures straightforward code.
- Creates better test seams when behavior truly varies, but can fragment logic when the variation is small.
- Works best when the abstraction is named after the domain role rather than the pattern label.

## Failure Modes
- Introducing the pattern before the variation point is stable enough to justify a boundary.
- Leaking host object state into collaborators until the design becomes harder to reason about.
- Naming production types after generic pattern roles instead of domain concepts.

## Testing
- Test through the behavior boundary that callers actually use.
- Add focused tests for each variant, construction path, or collaboration rule introduced by the pattern.
- Preserve behavior with parity tests before deleting old branches or constructors.

## Observability
- For runtime-selected variants, log the selected domain strategy, factory path, state, or collaborator role at debug or trace level.
- Avoid noisy pattern-level logs; surface only decisions that help diagnose production behavior.
- Add metrics only when the pattern changes runtime routing, cost, latency, or failure behavior.

## Implementation Notes
- Introduce Template Method at the smallest boundary where variation, construction, or collaboration changes independently.
- Prefer idiomatic language features before adding class-heavy structure.
- Keep public behavior stable first, then simplify old conditionals or construction paths once tests prove parity.
