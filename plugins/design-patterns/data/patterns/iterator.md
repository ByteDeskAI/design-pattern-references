tradeoffs:
  - Adds explicit structure and vocabulary for the force.

  - Requires tests that prove the new boundary preserves behavior.
failureModes:
  - Pattern name becomes more important than the problem force.
  - Ownership and lifecycle rules remain implicit.
  - The implementation hides simpler language or framework idioms.
testingFocus:
  - Behavior parity at the public boundary.
  - Variant or flow-specific edge cases.
  - Regression checks for the force the pattern addresses.
observabilityFocus:
  - Decision points that affect runtime behavior.
  - Failure paths introduced by the new boundary.

# Iterator

## Intent
Provide sequential access to elements without exposing the underlying representation.

## When To Use
- Clients need traversal without knowing collection internals.
- Different traversal orders should be supported.
- Traversal state must be externalized or composable.

## Avoid When
- The language's native iteration protocol is enough.
- Exposing iteration hides expensive remote or streaming behavior.
- A query abstraction communicates intent better.

## Language Notes

### csharp
Use IEnumerable, yield return, and async streams.

### java
Use Iterable, streams, or spliterators as appropriate.

### typescript
Use iterable protocols, generators, and async iterables.

### python
Use iterators, generators, and context-aware streaming.

### go
Range works for built-ins; iterator functions are emerging idioms.

### rust
Iterator is a central trait; compose adapters freely.

### cpp
STL iterators and ranges are the idiomatic form.

## Forces
- Keep the variation point explicit without spreading conditionals or construction knowledge through callers.
- Preserve domain names and dependency direction while making behavior easier to test in isolation.
- Balance indirection against the simplicity of language-native functions, modules, records, or interfaces.

## Tradeoffs
- Improves local change isolation, but can add indirection that obscures straightforward code.
- Creates better test seams when behavior truly varies, but can fragment logic when the variation is small.
- Works best when the abstraction is named after the domain role rather than the pattern label.

## Failure Modes
- Introducing the pattern before the variation point is stable enough to justify a boundary.
- Leaking host object state into collaborators until the design becomes harder to reason about.
- Naming production types after generic pattern roles instead of domain concepts.

## Testing
- Test through the behavior boundary that callers actually use.
- Add focused tests for each variant, construction path, or collaboration rule introduced by the pattern.
- Preserve behavior with parity tests before deleting old branches or constructors.

## Observability
- For runtime-selected variants, log the selected domain strategy, factory path, state, or collaborator role at debug or trace level.
- Avoid noisy pattern-level logs; surface only decisions that help diagnose production behavior.
- Add metrics only when the pattern changes runtime routing, cost, latency, or failure behavior.

## Implementation Notes
- Introduce Iterator at the smallest boundary where variation, construction, or collaboration changes independently.
- Prefer idiomatic language features before adding class-heavy structure.
- Keep public behavior stable first, then simplify old conditionals or construction paths once tests prove parity.
